# TSP
Currently in my third year at Uni. I am practicing implementing alogrithms to actual code. This is my take on the TSP problem using the B&B algorithm.

Instructions:
Enter the matrix, as prompted. Solution path should then print out.

Notes:
This uses the B&B algorithm for solving the shortest path. Graph must be hamiltonian.
